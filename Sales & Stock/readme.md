This project is built using a modern and efficient technology stack designed for performance, reliability, and ease of use. The backend is developed in Spring Boot, leveraging Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate to provide a robust REST API with seamless database operations. Passwords are securely encrypted using BCrypt, ensuring safe user authentication. The system stores data in PostgreSQL, chosen for its stability and strong relational capabilities. On the frontend side, the interface is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, delivering a lightweight, fast, and responsive user experience without relying on heavy frameworks. Additional functionality includes ZXing for QR generation, used to create product-level QR codes. File-handling capabilities built into Java automatically generate monthly CSV sales reports. Together, this stack forms a powerful yet simple system ideal for small businesses managing sales and inventory digitally.
